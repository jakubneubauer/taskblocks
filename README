TaskBlocks README
=================

What is it
----------
TaskBlocks is simple application to help planning tasks. From version 0.5 it
supports also exporting tasks as Bugzilla bugs.

Installation
------------
You need Java 5.0 or higher installed to run TaskBlocks. So, if you don't
have it, install it first, for example from <http://java.sun.com>. Mac OS X users
need to update their 10.x system, which will install Java 5.0.

Having Java 5.0 or higher installed, just download the latest taskblocks.jar
file (or Mac users the .dmg file).

  * Windows users should be able to run it double-clicking on the downloaded
        taskblocks.jar file. If it doesn't work, try to run from a commandline:

        java -jar PATH_TO_JAR_FILE

        If it still doesn't work, ask your personal IT guru for help ;-)

  * Linux and other-platforms users probably have to run the application from
	    commandline like we have just described. Maybe double-clicking will
        work on some installations

  * MacOS X users can download the .dmg package and install it in obvious way -
        double-clicking the .dmg file and dragging the application icon to your
        Applications folder.

Usage
-----
The application interface should be so intuitive, that no further manual should
be needed ;-) If you find something not easilly understandable, you can write
to the autor. Your comments are welcome.

Building from source
--------------------
To build the application from source, you need to download the source package,
and java compiler. The best way is to run ant. If you don't have it, just
compile the sources in usual way. There are no other libraries dependencies.
