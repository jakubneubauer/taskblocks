    <h2>Simple Tasks Scheduling</h2>
    <p>
    This is the web of Task Blocks application. This application can help you
    schedule projects consisted of many tasks in case you have "one-to-many"
    relation between people and their tasks.

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
    For purposes of our project I needed simple utility to schedule tasks.
There are available some scheduling applications
(<a href="http://ganttproject.biz/">Gantt Project</a>,
MS Project,
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Planner/">Gnome Planner</a>).
Actually they are so
much general, that some simple things are almost impossible with them. For
example in Gantt Project wasn’t possible to specify that one man can work only
on one task at the same time. I consider desirable when an application checks
such a constraints and adjusts tasks automatically.

    <p> So I decided to write such an application. I wanted to make an
application, in which the manipulation with tasks is as easy as manipulating
pieces of puzzle on the table desk. Finally, after successfully using it, I
decided to share it with other people and to provide it with open source code.
I hope you will enjoy using it.

    <h2>Main Features</h2>
    <p>The features I like:
    <ul>
       <li> <p>Tasks of one man never coincide. They are automatically re-planned. Of course, the dependency is taken into account too.
       <li> <p>Free task manipulation. You can move tasks within the tasks-area and “resize” them with Drag&amp;Drop. Holding Shift-key you define new dependency constraint.
       <li> <p>The "shrink" button adjusts the starting times of tasks so there remain no empty spaces between them (if possible). The tasks order is preserved.
       <li> <p>Simple task creation - you can choose “Don’t close dialog” when adding new task, which allows you to add more tasks very quickly.
     </ul>
